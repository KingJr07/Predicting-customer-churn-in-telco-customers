# Telco Customer Churn Prediction using Deep Learning Techniques

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict customer churn in the telecommunications industry using deep learning techniques. The goal is to help telcos identify customers who are likely to churn, so they can take proactive measures to retain them.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is a historical customer data from a telecommunications company. It includes information such as demographics, account information, services used, and whether or not the customer churned.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- TensorFlow 2.0+
- Keras
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## Installation
To install the necessary libraries, run the following command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
To run the script, use the following command:
```
python main.py
```

## Model
We use a deep learning model for this task. The model is a fully connected neural network implemented in Keras. It takes as input the customer data and outputs the probability of the customer churning.

## Results
The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The results are visualized using confusion matrix and ROC curve.

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.


## Acknowledgements
We would like to thank the telecommunications company for providing the dataset for this project. We would also like to thank all the contributors for their valuable inputs and suggestions.
